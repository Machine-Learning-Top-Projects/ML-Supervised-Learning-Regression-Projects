# Contribution Guidelines

If you have got an optimized solution to a problem or, lets say, the existing solution is failing on some test cases and you got a working solution, then there is really a high chance of getting you pull request being accepted. 
**Note:** If you have got an optimised solution, but the existing solution is also working, then:
1. Make another file in the corresponding folder'
2. Name it `<problem name in snake case>-<your name in snake case>-Optimized.cpp`. for example, if the problem name is `Angry Children`, then name of the file which will contain the optimized code should be `angry_children-parikshit_singh-Optimized.cpp`
3. Generate a pull request and wait.
